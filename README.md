# Space Invaders
This is a game bas upon the "C++ Qt Game Tutorial" by Abdullah Aghazadah
on YouTube. It works as a playground for me to get more comfortable in
both C++ and Qt. I will (hopefully) start improving the code using patterns
from the book "Game Programming Patterns" by Roberty Nystrom. Therefore
there is no guarantee it will compile and work on your computer since I
might leave it in a state where it does not even work for me.

## Possible future improvements
* Get the music to actually play (on my computer)
* Randomize the size of the enemies
* Randomize the speed of the enemies
* Maybe vary the speed while on screen for the enemies
* Ensure that the enemies start a certain position apart from each other
* Add automatic weapon upgrades when reaching a certain score
* Possibility for the user to configure the keybindings as he/she wants it
* Possibility to change the resolution
* Etc...
